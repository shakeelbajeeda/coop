                <div class="line-1"><br>
                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: justify;">There is so much redundancy in the tasks Commercial Real Estate Brokers perform from start to finish in listing a property. From creating CMAs and running comps to win a listing, to building marketing materials, uploading to search sites and blasting alerts to brokers, we repeat the same Input steps to multiple platforms over and over again. But along the way, information gets lost, status updates get missed, photos go out of date or get pulled from archives and google maps, resulting in conflicting materials entering the marketplace, not to mention endless hours spent at a computer screen that could be spent with clientele.<br><br>
                        Don’t even get us started on the money that gets wasted on over-priced, under performing, and one-dimensional tech platforms. We created the Commercial Co-Op to streamline the day-to-day life of a Commercial Broker and connect the community that keeps Brokers thriving.<br><br>
                        How do we know all of this? Simple. We are brokers in a small commercial firm in Denver, Colorado that got fed up with per broker tech costs of over $2,500/month and decided there has to be a better way. When the pandemic hit, we knew it would be more important than ever to work smarter and save money. We built this product for US and everyone we work with.</p>

She spent 10 years as a professional singer touring the country with several rock & roll, blues, bluegrass, and swing bands before she moved to Steamboat Springs in 2000.<br><br>
                        Amy spent 7 years in Steamboat as a Hotel GM and another 5 years as the President of a Commercial Property Management Company identifying, restoring, remodeling, leasing and managing several large downtown commercial buildings for a single owner.

She specialized in Commercial Lending and fulfilling long term goals of the Jamis Companies’ clientele. During this time, Marsha assisted Jay in his real estate and development division. Before the housing crisis of 2008, Jay and Marsha made a joint decision that the Mortgage and Finance Sector was far too unsettled to offer great service to their clients, closing down that section of the business.<br><br>
                            During Marsha’s 17 years with Jamis Companies, she has tackled many different positions to assist Jay in his businesses.</p>
